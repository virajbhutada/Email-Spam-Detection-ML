## Problem Statement

Email spam, or junk mail, poses a significant challenge to users and organizations alike, as it clutters inboxes, wastes time, and can contain malicious content. The primary objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated email spam detection system utilizing advanced machine-learning techniques. By analyzing the content and characteristics of emails, the system aims to accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate (ham).
