## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
* **Data Cleaning:** Removed noise and inconsistencies from the dataset.
* **Feature Extraction:** Extracted relevant features, including the sender's address, subject line, and email body, to represent email content effectively.

### Model Selection and Training
* **Algorithm Selection:** Employed a combination of algorithms, including Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, to achieve optimal performance.
* **Model Training:** Trained the selected models on the preprocessed dataset, fine-tuning hyperparameters to maximize accuracy.

### Evaluation
* **Performance Metrics:** Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **Cross-Validation:** Utilized cross-validation to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.

## Results and Discussion

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Revealed that approximately **13.41%** of emails were classified as spam, providing a critical foundation for model training.
* **Feature Importance:** Identified keywords like **"free," "call,"** and **"text"** as significant indicators of spam, highlighting the importance of effective feature engineering.
* **Model Performance:** The **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model achieved an impressive accuracy of **98.49%** on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in spam detection. This level of accuracy indicates the model's potential for practical implementation in email filtering systems.
